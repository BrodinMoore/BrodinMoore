### Hello World!
## I'm Brodin Moore, I am currently studying programming through the Tech Elevator summer bootcamp!
## I have a deep interest in coding and Ai and seek to learn and improve upon my skills throughout the coming months.
## A personal project that I would like to try would be creating an Ai chatbot that can actively communicate with a user through speech to text.
## Another would be to create a controller for a cross-spherical gear.
## I'm greatly looking forward to the next few months and hope this repository will reflect my progress!
